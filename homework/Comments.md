#### Overall

This is very good work. Try to start early enough that if can't get part of the script working, you'll have time to email us or come to office hours.

(Note: Your repo's not private yet; best fix that.)

#### Correctness

There's a problem with the ending-initial glides in the "way" and "yay" dialects, as noted in the other document. Overall everything works as expected.

#### Readability

There is a lot of stray code here commented out. Try to avoid this because it's distracting.

#### Documentation

It's excellent that you comment on the parts where the script didn't work as expected. Keep it up.

#### Efficiency

Whenever you find the same thing repeated with only a slight variation, consider whether there's a way to deal with the variation in advance. So with the vowel list, for instance, transforming the string to lowercase would simplify the process greatly.
